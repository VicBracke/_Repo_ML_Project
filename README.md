# Machine Learning Repository for PRDL & MLLB courses

This repository provides a comprehensive set of tools and analyses for understanding and applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques to the Breast Cancer and OSA datasets. It is created for the course of Predictive and Descriptive Learning & Machine Learning Lab, followed at the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM). Each directory is structured to guide you through the process of data extraction, exploratory data analysis, and model training and testing.

## Directories

### BreastCancer
This directory contains the following directories and notebooks related to the Breast Cancer dataset:
- **Images**: Directory containing the figures used for the report.
- **data**: Directory containing the Breast Cancer dataset used for the report.
- **1_Data_Extraction.ipynb**: Notebook for extracting and preprocessing the Breast Cancer dataset.
- **2_EDA.ipynb (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Notebook that explore the dataset, visualize distributions, and identify patterns.
