# Machine Learning Repository for PRDL & MLLB courses

This repository contains the data and code files that are created for the course of Predictive and Descriptive Learning & Machine Learning Lab.

## Directories

### BreastCancer
This directory contains the following files and notebooks related to the Breast Cancer dataset:
- **Data extraction**: Scripts for extracting and preprocessing the Breast Cancer dataset.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Notebooks that explore the dataset, visualize distributions, and identify patterns.
- **ML Models**: Notebooks and scripts for training and testing various machine learning models for classification tasks, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

### OSA_CaseStudy
This directory contains the following files and notebooks related to the OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea) Case Study:
- **Data extraction**: Scripts for extracting and preprocessing the OSA dataset.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Notebooks that explore the dataset, visualize distributions, and identify patterns.
- **ML Models**: Notebooks and scripts for training and testing various machine learning models for regression, classification, and clustering tasks, including linear regression, k-means clustering, and random forests.

## Conclusion
This repository provides a comprehensive set of tools and analyses for understanding and applying machine learning techniques to the Breast Cancer and OSA datasets. Each directory is structured to guide you through the process of data extraction, exploratory data analysis, and model training and testing.
